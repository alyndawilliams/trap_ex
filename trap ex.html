      <h3>HOBBIES</h3>        
      <p>Some things I like to do in my free time is watch Netflix and I do that almost everyday. My second favorite thing to do it be on the phone with my boyfriend and I do that EVERYDAY when I say every I really mean EVERYDAY.</p>
      <p>I also play soccer and that makes me happy that why I would like to just play it for fun. I think competitive soccer is just too much and that's just not my cup of tea but for fun yeah. I also enjoy watching Youtube Videos. I really just enjoy hearing people's stories and the different products they use to see if I can use them myself. </p>
